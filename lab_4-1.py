#Find the users first name 
first_name =  input('What is you first name?')

#Find the user's last name
last_name = input('What is your last name?')

# Full name variable
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name

# If you add the two varibables together, there is no space between names
# We fixed this by putting + ' ' in between the two names :)
